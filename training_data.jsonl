Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n\n1. Sets up the game window and initializes Pygame.\n2. Defines colors and game parameters.\n3. Creates functions for drawing the snake and displaying messages.\n4. Implements the main game loop, which handles:\n   - User input for controlling the snake\n   - Snake movement and growth\n   - Collision detection with walls and self\n   - Food spawning and eating\n   - Game over conditions\n\nTo run this game, you'll need to have Pygame installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n```cmd\npip install pygame\n```\n\nThen, you can run the game using:\n\n```cmd\npython snake_game.py\n```\n\nThis implementation covers the basic functionality of a snake game. Let me know if you want to add any additional features or make any modifications!"}]}
